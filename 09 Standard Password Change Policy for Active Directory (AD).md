## üîê Standard Password Change Policy for Active Directory (AD)

### 1. **Password Complexity Requirements**

Enforce users to create strong passwords:

* Minimum length: **8 to 14 characters** (some recommend 12+)
* Must contain at least **3 of the 4 categories**:

  * Uppercase letters (A-Z)
  * Lowercase letters (a-z)
  * Numbers (0-9)
  * Special characters (!, @, #, \$, %, etc.)
* No passwords based on username or full name

---

### 2. **Password Expiration**

* Passwords should **expire every 30 to 90 days** depending on organizational policy.
* Typical: **90 days** is common in many enterprises.
* Users must change passwords **before expiry** (e.g., notify 14 days before expiry).

---

### 3. **Password History**

* Remember last **24 passwords** to prevent reuse.
* Prevents users from cycling through old passwords.

### 4. **Account Lockout Policy**

* Lock account after **3 to 5 failed login attempts**.
* Lockout duration: **15 minutes** or until admin unlocks.
* Helps protect against brute-force attacks.

### 5. **User Password Change Rights**

* Allow users to **change their password at any time**.
* Enforce **minimum password age** (e.g., 1 day) to prevent immediate password cycling.

## 🛠️ Step-by-Step Setup of Windows Event Forwarding (Domain Environment)

---

### ✅ Components Overview

| Role              | Server/Device                                    | Purpose                |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| **Collector**     | A central Windows Server (e.g., DC, file server) | Receives logs          |
| **Source/Client** | Domain PCs/servers                               | Send logs to collector |

---

## ✅ Step 1: Configure the Event Collector Server

1. **Log in to your collector server** (e.g., `Server01`)
2. Open PowerShell (Admin) and run:

```powershell
wecutil qc
```

> This sets up the **Windows Event Collector** service and enables it.

3. Go to **Services** and ensure:

   * `Windows Event Collector` = Running, Automatic

---

## ✅ Step 2: Create a Subscription (Collector Side)

1. Open **Event Viewer**

2. In the left pane, click:

   ```
   Subscriptions > Create Subscription
   ```

3. Fill out:

   * **Name**: Workstation Logon Events
   * **Destination Log**: Forwarded Events (default)
   * **Collector initiated** (recommended for domain use)

4. Click **Select Events**:

   * For example: Security log → Event ID 4624, 4625, 4672
   * You can use XML filters too (optional)

5. Click **Select Computers** > Add domain computers (or an AD group)

---

## ✅ Step 3: Configure GPO on Client Systems

To allow clients to forward logs to the collector:

1. Open **Group Policy Management Console (`gpmc.msc`)**
2. Create a new GPO: `WEF Client Policy`
3. Edit it:

---

### 🔹 Enable WinRM (Remote Event Access)

```
Computer Configuration
→ Policies
→ Administrative Templates
→ Windows Components
→ Windows Remote Management (WinRM)
→ WinRM Service
→ Allow remote server management through WinRM
```

* Set to **Enabled**
* Add: `*` or FQDN of collector

---

### 🔹 Set up Windows Event Forwarding

```
Computer Configuration
→ Policies
→ Administrative Templates
→ Windows Components
→ Event Forwarding
→ Configure target Subscription Manager
```

* Set to **Enabled**
* Value (example):

  ```
  Server=HTTP://server01.xitiztechservices.local:5985/wsman/SubscriptionManager/WEC,Refresh=60
  ```

> Adjust FQDN accordingly.

---

## ✅ Step 4: Link GPO and Update Clients

* Link the GPO to your **domain computers** OU
* On clients, run:

```bash
gpupdate /force
```

* Confirm WinRM is listening:

```powershell
winrm quickconfig
```

---

## ✅ Step 5: Verify Log Forwarding

On the **collector server**:

* Open **Event Viewer**
* Go to:

  ```
  Applications and Services Logs > Microsoft > Windows > EventCollector
  ```
* You’ll also see logs appear under:

  ```
  Forwarded Events
  ```

---

## 📋 Sample Use Case: Track Failed Logons

Monitor `Event ID 4625` from all domain machines:

* Create a subscription for Security logs with that ID
* Forward them to `Server01`
* Filter by `SubjectUserName` or `WorkstationName`
